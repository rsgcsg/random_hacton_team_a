The biggest challenge facing our planet is how to maintain and manage our natural systems such as fisheries, forestry and biodiversity in the face of habitat destruction, climate change, pollution and over harvesting. In this course you will learn how to apply deterministic differential and difference equation models to real world examples, and how to solve them using numerical methods in MATLAB. You will also learn how to quantify system uncertainties with the help of statistical and probabilistic methods. Students will be taught a range of methods which are employed in industry, research, consultancies and government to model complex natural resource problems. In the process, students will learn how certain fundamental mathematical concepts such as critical points, orthogonality, eigenvalues and singularity recur in different mathematical frameworks with different but, invariably, vitally important physical interpretations."

In addition to classical applications, most examples will particularly focus on modern large-scale machine learning problems. Implementations will be done using MATLAB/Python. The students will also be exposed to cutting-edge developments including randomised variants of many classical deterministic methods. Students will be taught a range of analytical and algorithmic tools that are employed in research and industry, such as various matrix types, their properties and factorisations, iterative algorithms for matrix computations such as Krylov subspace methods, various eigen-solvers, elements of convex and non-convex analysis, derivative free as well as first and second-order optimisation methods, constrained and unconstrained optimisation algorithms, and introduction to non-smooth and stochastic optimisation."

Emphasis is placed on a precise understanding of randomness and probability distributions, and statistical methods such as estimation, hypothesis testing, analysis of variance, regression and linear models, logistic regression, categorical data analysis and non-parametric methods. The course also covers exploratory data analysis, the design of experiments and ethical research, as well as the importance of critical thinking and communication in the interpretation of results."

To emphasize the importance and generality of these tools, a number of key contemporary topics in science will be studied, including climate change, population dynamics, drugs and pharmacokinetics, and epidemics. The course will demonstrate how and why mathematical models underpin modern science, and students will learn how to develop and analyse such models. The course also introduces computer programming (using the language Python) as a vital tool in modern scientific modelling. Students will be introduced to some fundamental philosophical issues in science, gaining an appreciation of some of the assumptions that underlie science and the supposed scientific method, reinforcing the importance of critical thinking, creativity and quantitative scientific skills."
