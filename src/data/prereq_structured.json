SWSP4183 has a very practical, skills-based focus, and engages directly with some of the most challenging and confronting areas of practice such as suicide risk assessment and the administration of a Mental State Examination. To this end it is important to note that the course will regularly confront students with discussions of major mental illness, sudden death, suicide, trauma, and child sexual abuse. It is scarcely possible to practise in the field without encountering these phenomena, and part of the experience of studying SWSP4183 will be the need for students to develop individual ways of coping with stressful content. Please note also that the skills focus of the course will require students to engage regularly in role-play activities. SWSP4183 has consistently received strong positive feedback from students as a safe and supportive environment in which to develop the skills necessary for effective practice in mental health. This year will be no exception! The Bachelor of Social Work (Hons) program is accredited by the Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW). The AASW Accreditation Standards (2020) stipulate that accredited social work programs are required to include content that addresses the five core curriculum areas listed below. SWSP4183 contains content in all five curriculum areas: 1. Constructions of social work purpose, place, and practice 2. Power, oppression, and exploitation 3. The history and contribution of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples 4. Culture, identity, and discrimination 5. Psychosocial health and wellbeing across the lifecycle"},

This course focuses on building an understanding of the complexity of navigating these changes in organisations for healthy and productive workplaces and sustainable outcomes for the organisation, their stakeholders and society as a whole. Topics covered will include classic and contemporary approaches to managing change and designing organisations, critical evaluation of alternatives, ethical and wellbeing perspectives, and the application of practical tools in facilitating effective processes. We will develop skills in working with leaders, employees and other stakeholders to diagnose change issues and opportunities, design effective intervention strategies and then implement, evaluate, adjust and support these strategies in practice to sustain the change over time."},

The course consists of integrated lectures on physical-biological oceanography and climate change effects to provide the interdisciplinary foundation increasingly required in the contemporary environmental sciences. It covers the influence of the oceans on human activities and the influence of human activities on the characteristics of the oceans. Practicals will focus on learning to acquire and work with oceanography data platforms."},

When combined with racial and ideological hostility, such factors formed a potent mix, resulting in wars that reached new heights of intensity and which plunged depths of depravity.

It considers different kinds of historical revolutions relating to politics, science, social life, ideas, culture, and behaviour that have decisively shaped the modern condition. Key topics include the French, American, and Haitian Revolutions of the end of the eighteenth century inspired by new forms of representative government and human rights, and the scientific revolutions (associated with Copernicus, Newton, and Darwin) that changed the way humans understood themselves in relation to the natural world. The course also examines the various Industrial Revolutions that witnessed dramatic changes in economic relationships due to the respective adoption of coal-fired, chemical, and digital technologies; and social and cultural revolutions, such as arguments for the emancipation of women, the Modernist cultural revolution, and the Russian Revolution of 1917, all of which imagined a reordering of society and human experience. In recent history, both the post-war Green Revolution and the Sexual Revolution of the 1960s have radically challenged social conventions and behaviours. Taken together, these revolutions all had global ramifications that shaped the political, social, cultural, and intellectual landscapes of our world today. Throughout the course, students will read both primary and secondary sources to gain insight into these transformative moments in global history. They will be challenged to think about some of the deeper conceptual issues related to \"revolution\" itself: as an idea, as an event, and as a category of historical analysis. What makes a historical event a \"revolution\"? How do historians use the term to make sense of the past, compared to its everyday usage? Why are some events considered a revolution while others are not? Can our present world be understood as the result of previous revolutionary outcomes?"},

The course aims to introduce students not just to what happened, the individuals, incidents, sequences of events, and dramas of East Asia's modern history, but also and more importantly to major problems of modern East Asian history. Over the last century and a half East Asia has played a pivotal role in world history. In the nineteenth century the Western imperial powers and Japan gradually replaced Chinese hegemony in East Asia. All of Southeast Asia with the exception of Siam (Thailand), came under European colonial rule. Japan emerged as an economic and imperial power in its own right. This led to the rise of national liberation movements throughout East Asia, based both on indigenous traditions and Western political philosophies, which challenged both indigenous rulers and colonial states. Ideas of social and gender equality and political freedom were central to the political platforms of many of these movements. The Japanese invasion of China in 1937 and Southeast Asia at the end 1941 set in place a train of events that would lead to Japan's own defeat in WWII, the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, and the independence of Southeast Asian nations in the 1940s-1960s. The economic transformation that took place during the post-war period, first in Japan, then other East Asian nations, and then in China, would reintegrate the East Asian region economically. This course shows students how contemporary events in East Asia have their roots in the tumultuous history of the last century and a half."},

Many of the plants in the Australian environment also contain compounds that are used to treat illness in Indigenous communities, providing a second important reason for understanding these foods. The first module will explore different bush foods, investigate food safety and processing, and explore unique flavours. The second module will discuss issues around other values of bush foods such as nutrition, medical and preservative value. In the third module, we will investigate issues around commercialisation and equitable benefit sharing for bush foods brought into mainstream cuisine. The practicals will align with the lectures, and in the last two practicals you will have the opportunity to use bush foods to create a new food product. At each lecture, we will spend some time tasting a bushfood. The minimum enrolment for this course is 15 to be offered."},

This course is a logical progression from the remote sensing concepts and skills introduced in GEOM2000/7000. GEOM3001/7001 emphasises digital image processing for analysis of remotely sensed imagery, including airborne and satellite multi-spectral, hyper-spectral and synthetic aperture radar data. Practical sessions will involve a progression of practicals in the computer laboratory using the ENVI (Environment for Visualising Images) software package. Concepts and skills acquired in these sessions will be applied in the individual student remote sensing project that can be designed to suit your area of interest."},

ARCA1000 is an introduction to the core concepts and principles of contemporary archaeology, considering its history, ethics and practices in global perspective. Case studies explore how archaeology investigates topics as diverse as where and when humans evolved, the development of art and symbolism, how past societies survived in the face of extreme climate change, developing partnerships with First Nations peoples to explore Australia's past and archaeology's role in politics, power and privilege, from colonial dispossession and enslavement to the impact of Black Lives Matter on our own practice. A key focus is understanding how archaeologists make and verify claims about the past through critical analysis of its material remains, and we explore the difference between archaeology as a formal academic discipline and the fantastical claims of pseudoarchaeology. Lectures are accompanied by problem-solving tutorials, and diverse assessments, including a video assignment and site significance reports, providing students with a gateway to professional practice in the discipline via the archaeology and archaeological science Extended Major/Major programs or a broad-based introduction for scholars in other areas of inquiry."},
